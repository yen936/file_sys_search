EFS is a high-performance, multithreaded file search utility written in Rust. It's designed to quickly scan large directory structures and locate files based on various criteria.

This came from Windows search being too slow in our petabyte scale file share. 

## Preformance Benchmarking

## Features

- üöÄ **Fast**: Utilizes multithreading for parallel directory traversal
- üå≥ **Efficient**: Implements a tree-based search algorithm
- üíª **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Installation

Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

Then, clone this repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yen936/file_sys_search.git
cd file-system-search
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available in target/.

## Usage
Run the program with
```bash
cd file_sys_search
cargo run
```

## Performance

EFS is designed to be significantly faster than traditional single-threaded search utilities, especially on systems with multiple CPU cores and when searching across large directory structures or network-attached storage.
